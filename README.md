# Goal
Development of a pipeline that will run all the steps for assembling golden mussels' genomes in an automated way. This will allow us to assembly multiple golden mussels' genomes, as we will be interested in studying mussels from different environments. 

# Strategy to achieve it 
The pipeline will be run using a Workflow tool from the Galaxy platform. This tool allow us to create a pipeline where each one software's output will be forwarded as input for the next one.
