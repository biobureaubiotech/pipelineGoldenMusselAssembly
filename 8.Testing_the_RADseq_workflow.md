##### Downloading all FASTQ files for the selected experiment  
So far we have tested our workflow (*SNP calling on paired end data - v3*) using only one FASTQ file (what means one sample out of 96) as input. In order to get closer to what would mean the real analysis, we have merged (using *cat* command) two FASTQ files and used the merged file (*SRR6725877_SRR6725878_merged.fastq
*) as input for the workflow. 

We are currently running the workflow to test if the merging of the FASTQ files from different samples would cause any problem.

##### Running *SNP calling on paired end data - v3* workflow for complete set of samples  
The *SNP calling on paired end data - v3* workflow has finished its execution successfully for the complete FASTQ file (the one with all the 96 samples from the original experiment). 
However, a posterior analysis using SnpEff tool has shown an unexpected output. We decided to check the quality of the complete FASTQ file using FASTQC software. FASTQC has pointed out the following error:  
> Failed to process file all-samples.fastq  
uk.ac.babraham.FastQC.Sequence.SequenceFormatException: ID line didn't start with '@'  

To fix this error, we have ran the script [clean_fastq.pl](https://github.com/biobureaubiotech/pipelineGoldenMusselAssembly/blob/master/scripts/clean_fastq.pl), that detects and corrects errors at FASTQ files. The command to execute the script was:  
```console  
rpgisi21@DKT38375:~$ perl clean_fastq.pl all-samples.fastq > all-samples-verified.fastq  
```  

Which fixed the file *all-samples.fastq* and created a correct *all-samples-verified.fastq* file.

##### Running *SNP calling on paired end data - v3* workflow for fixed complete set of samples  
After running the workflow with the fixed *all-samples-verified.fastq*, we have again run the SnpEff tool to get summarized stats for the VCF file. Again, we had a potentially weird output, whose HTML file indicated a possible mismatch between the name of the chromosomes of the VCF file and the name of the chromosomes at the *A. gambieae* genome from the SnpEff tool.  

#### To Do  
- Check the name of the chromosomes at the SnpEff database and correct if they are indeed different from the VCF file. 
- Install and execute GEMINI
