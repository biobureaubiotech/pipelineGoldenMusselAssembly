##### Creating a Galaxy workflow for RADseq analysis  
Because our GCloud resources were blocked, we started building the workflow for analysing the RADseq data at the [Galaxy public server](https://usegalaxy.org/). The workflow was named RADseq-analysis, but it is not complete yet (it doesn't cover all steps as done in the paper of the original work).
