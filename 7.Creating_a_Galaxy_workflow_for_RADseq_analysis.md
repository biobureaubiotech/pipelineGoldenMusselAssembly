##### Creating a Galaxy workflow for RADseq analysis  
Because our GCloud resources were blocked, we started building the workflow for analysing the RADseq data at the [Galaxy public server](https://usegalaxy.org/). The workflow was named RADseq-analysis, but it is not complete yet (it doesn't cover all steps as done in the paper of the original work).

##### Modifying the workflow for RADseq analysis  
Since Galaxy no longer supports the GATK Unified Genotyper and GATK Variant Filtration tools. Instead, we will follow the [pipeline](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/dip/tutorial.html) for variant calling analysis recommended by the Galaxy project. We startet testing the Galaxy-recommended pipeline (created as a workflow named *SNP calling on paired end data - v3*), and can manage to execute it successfully until the FreeBayes step, i.e., we can already build a *VCF* file. Other steps are to test the software SnpEff to annotate our variant calling file and then the software GEMINI, to make queries to the annotated *VCF*.

##### Creating a SnpEff database for the golden mussel 
We have built a customized SnpEff database for the limnoperna fortunei genome. In order to do that, we had to first create a genbank file for that genome and then import that file to the Galaxy instance. The genbank file was created at a local machine (SENAI's desktop) by running the command:  

```console  
rpgisi21@DKT38375:~/Documentos/lfortunei_gender/get_genbank_file perl gff2gbSmallDNA.pl lfortunei_genome.gff LF.genome.fasta 1 lfortunei_genome_1b.gb
```  

The final genbank file had a 1 bp flanking region, as it wasn't possible to not include the flanking region using the script [gff2gbSmallDNA.pl](https://github.com/biobureaubiotech/pipelineGoldenMusselAssembly/blob/master/scripts/gff2gbSmallDNA.pl). That file was then uploaded to the Galaxy instance to the RAD-seq history. It was then given as input for the *SnpEff build* tool, which created a database for the golden mussel named *SnpEff4.3 database for Lfortunei*.
